# **ShipBob API Guides**  

ShipBobâ€™s public API enables a wide range of use cases. This guide walks you through the most common integration scenarios.

## **Getting Started with ShipBob API**  

To build an integration, youâ€™ll primarily use the following API endpoints:

### **1. Order Management**
- **[Create an Order (POST)](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Orders/paths/~11.0~1order/post)** â€“ Allows you to create orders in ShipBob.
- **[Get Order Details (GET)](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Orders/paths/~11.0~1order/get)** â€“ Fetches tracking details. For automated shipment updates, use [webhooks](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Webhooks).

### **2. Inventory Management**
- **[Get Inventory (GET)](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Inventory/paths/~11.0~1inventory~1%7BinventoryId%7D/get)** â€“ Retrieves inventory levels across ShipBobâ€™s facilities, including:
  - **On Hand**: Total stock at the warehouse.
  - **Fulfillable**: Available stock minus committed orders.
  - **Sellable**: Fulfillable stock minus exceptions (only at a network-wide level).

### **3. Authentication**
Authentication is handled via **OAuth** or **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**.

- For custom integrations, PATs are preferred. You can generate them in the [ShipBob Dashboard](https://developer.shipbob.com/auth).
- OAuth is required for multi-user integrations and marketplace apps.

## **Creating Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) Orders**  

To successfully create an order using the **Order POST** endpoint, ensure you provide the required fields:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specify Shipping Method">
    Choose from "Standard", "Expedited", "2-Day", etc. Merchants map these to specific ShipBob shipping options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Recipient Details">
    Include recipient name, Address1, City, and Country (ISO Alpha-2 recommended). Optionally, provide City and Zip Code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a Reference ID">
    This unique order number from your platform must be unique within the ShipBob account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Products">
    Pass product data using either **Reference ID Model** (recommended) or **Product ID Model**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Order Tags (Optional)">
    Tags can store extra metadata or trigger automation rules in ShipBob.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include shipbob_channel_id">
    Required in the request header. Retrieve via the [GET Channel](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Channels/paths/~11.0~1channel/get) endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For more details, refer to [ShipBob's Order API Documentation](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Orders/paths/~11.0~1order/post).

## **Retrieving Tracking & Fulfillment Details**

### **Option 1: Polling API Approach**
Use **[GET Orders](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Orders/paths/~11.0~1order/get)** to retrieve tracking updates. 
- Filter by `LastUpdateStartDate` and `LastUpdateEndDate` for efficient data sync.
- Use `HasTracking=true` to fetch only shipped orders.

### **Option 2: Webhooks (Recommended for Automation)**
ShipBob provides webhooks for shipment events:
- **Shipped**
- **Delivered**
- **Exception (e.g., out-of-stock issues)**
- **On Hold (e.g., invalid address)**
- **Cancelled**

To subscribe, make a **[Webhook POST Request](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Webhooks/paths/~11.0~1webhook/post)**.

## **Retrieving Inventory Levels**

ShipBobâ€™s **[GET Inventory](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs#tag/Inventory/paths/~11.0~1inventory/get)** endpoint provides inventory status.

### **Option 1: Fetch Products Before Syncing Inventory**
1. Retrieve all products using the **Product API**.
2. Get product inventory IDs from the response.
3. Use these IDs to fetch inventory levels via the **Inventory API**.

### **Option 2: Store Inventory IDs Upstream**
- Store ShipBobâ€™s `inventory_id` for each product in your system.
- Use this ID to fetch bulk inventory data efficiently.

## **Handling Warehouse Receiving Orders (WROs)**

ShipBob allows Warehouse Receiving Orders (WROs) to be created via API.

### **Relevant Endpoints:**
- **[Create WRO](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Receiving/paths/~12.0~1receiving/post)**
- **[Retrieve WRO Status](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Receiving/paths/~12.0~1receiving/get)**

### **WRO Process:**

1. Define `package_type`: **Pallet, Package, or FloorLoadedContainer**.
2. Ensure an **expected arrival date** is in the future.
3. Pass valid **ShipBob inventory_id** (fetch from **Product API** before sending WRO request).
4. Use a **unique purchase_order_number**.
5. Include scannable carton IDs for tracking.

For more details, visit [ShipBobâ€™s WRO API Documentation](https://developer.shipbob.com/api-docs/#tag/Receiving/paths/~12.0~1receiving/post).

| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid API token | Verify authentication headers |
| `404 Not Found` | Invalid endpoint or ID | Check request parameters |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded | Implement exponential backoff |

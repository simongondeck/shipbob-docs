title: "Rate limit"
---

API calls will be rate-limited to 150 requests per-minute using a sliding window, and will be totalled per user, per application across calls to any of the ShipBob APIs.

Please give us time to process your requests. If you're sending too many requests too quickly, we'll respond with a 429 error code (TooManyRequests).

The API response headers also give you the following rate limit detailed information:

| Header              | Example | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `x-retry-after`     | 25      | Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 25 seconds. |
| `x-remaining-calls` | 0       | You have 0 remaining calls                       |

```

    "statusCode": 429,
    "message": "Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 25 seconds."
}

# **ShipBob Authentication**  

ShipBob's Developer API supports two authentication methods based on your use case:

- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Ideal for single-user custom integrations.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Required for multi-user applications or apps listed on our App Store.

## **Choosing an Authentication Method**

| **Method** | **Use Case** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Personal Access Token (PAT)** | Single-user custom integrations. |
| **OAuth 2.0** | Multi-user integrations or apps listed on the App Store. |

---

## **Personal Access Token (PAT) Flow**

### **Generating a PAT**

1. Log in to your **ShipBob Dashboard**.
2. Generate a new **Personal Access Token** for your account.
3. Use this token as a **Bearer Token** in your API requests.

**Production & Sandbox Environments:**
- [Generate PAT for Production](#)
- [Generate PAT for Sandbox](#)

### **Using a PAT**

Your PAT should automatically have read and write access to the entire ShipBob account. To use it:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer [your_api_token]
```

### **Fetching Your Channel ID**
Before making API calls, use your PAT to get your **channel ID**:

```bash
GET https://api.shipbob.com/1.0/channel
```

A sample response:

```json
{
  "id": 56232,
  "name": "Personal Access Token Thursday, March 19, 2020",
  "application_name": "SMA",
  "scopes": ["orders_read", "products_read", "inventory_read"]
}
```

**Important:** PATs do not expire, so handle them securely.

## **OAuth Flow**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request OAuth Credentials">
    Fill out [this form](#) to request a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request User Authorization">
    Redirect users to `https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/authorize` with the required query parameters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Authorization Callback">
    Capture the `authorization_code` returned to your **callback URI**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exchange Code for Access Token">
    Send a `POST` request to `https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/token` to obtain an **access token**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the Access Token">
    Include the token in API requests as a **Bearer Token**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **OAuth Authorization Request**

Example request to obtain user authorization:

```bash
GET https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/authorize?
   client_id=MyCoolClient&
   scope=products_read channels_read offline_access&
   redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myapp.com%2Fintegrate%2Fshipbob%2Fcallback
```

### **Token Exchange Request**

Once the user grants access, exchange the authorization code for an access token:

```bash
POST https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/token

redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myapp.com%2Fintegrate%2Fshipbob%2Fcallback
&client_id=MyCoolApp
&client_secret=someSecret
&code=authorization_code
&grant_type=authorization_code
```

### **Token Response Example**

```json
{
  "access_token": "your_api_token",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

If you requested the `offline_access` scope, you will also receive a `refresh_token`:

```bash
POST https://auth.shipbob.com/connect/token

grant_type=refresh_token
&client_id=MyCoolApp
&client_secret=someSecret
&refresh_token=your_refresh_token
```

## **Scopes Overview**

| **Scope** | **Description** |
|----------|----------------|
| `orders_read` | Read orders data. |
| `orders_write` | Create and modify orders. |
| `products_read` | Read product details. |
| `products_write` | Create and modify products. |
| `fulfillments_read` | Read shipment details. |
| `inventory_read` | Access inventory data. |
| `channels_read` | Required for API operations. |
| `returns_read` | Retrieve return details. |
| `returns_write` | Create or update returns. |
| `webhooks_read` | Read user webhooks. |
| `webhooks_write` | Create or delete webhook subscriptions. |

---

## **Retrieving Your Channel ID**

All API calls require a **channel ID**. Fetch it using your **access token**:

```bash
GET https://api.shipbob.com/1.0/channel
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 12345,
    "name": "integration_name_unique_to_user"
  }
]
```

For multi-channel applications, identify the correct `channel_id` based on the scopes:

```json
{
  "id": 567890,
  "name": "My Awesome App",
  "scopes": ["orders_write", "inventory_write", "webhooks_write"]
}
```

Use this `channel_id` in the `shipbob_channel_id` header for all subsequent API calls.

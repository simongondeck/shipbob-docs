</Update>

<Update label="December 2024">
  ### 🚀 New Features

  * Introduced the

    `PUT 1.0/shipment`

    endpoint to indicate when tracking information has been uploaded. Use this endpoint to acknowledge that tracking details have been successfully synced to your system. Example:

    * Poll orders with tracking using

      `GET 1.0/order?HasTracking=true&IsTrackingUploaded=false`

      to retrieve orders where tracking has been provided but not yet confirmed as uploaded.

    * Once tracking is uploaded, call the

      `PUT 1.0/shipment`

      endpoint to mark it as uploaded.

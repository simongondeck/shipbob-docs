  Introduced the`PUT 1.0/shipment`endpoint to indicate when tracking information has been uploaded. Use this endpoint to acknowledge that tracking details have been successfully synced to your system. Here is example use case:

  * Poll orders with tracking using `GET 1.0/order?HasTracking=true&IsTrackingUploaded=false` to retrieve orders where tracking has been provided but not yet confirmed as uploaded.

  * Once tracking is uploaded, call the `PUT 1.0/shipment` endpoint to mark it as uploaded.

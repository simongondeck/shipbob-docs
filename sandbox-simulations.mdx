## Description

Our Sandbox simulations allow merchants to test their integrations before they start shipping with us. With these simulations, you can generate production-like data for specific actions and different states of those actions so that you can perform extensive testing and set up trigger alerts or any other actions beforehand.

<Tip>
  Before you can make requests to the ShipBob API, you will need to grab your API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Integrations » API Tokens](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/App/Merchant/)
</Tip>

## What are Simulation APIs?

These are APIs that can help you generate specific actions which are performed inside our ShipBob facility, where you can generate requests with data and get realistic responses that will happen in our facility. It is a fast and easy way of testing the integration even before it goes live. Thus, Simulation APIs let you identify any scenarios where your API can fail and allow you to better utilize these APIs by fixing those issues.

Before you can make requests to the ShipBob API, you will need to grab your API key from your dashboard. You find it under Settings » API .

description: "This quickstart guide intends to walk you through a few common scenarios to let you understand how to use the ShipBob API."
---



## 1. Get API key

ShipBob verifies a user's request by adding an as-api-key in the header.

On the ShipBob dashboard, go to Integrations > API Tokens. Click Generate New Token. Copy this token as we will use in next step. If you do not have a ShipBob account yet, you can create a sandbox account by following [this link](https://webstage.shipbob.dev/app/merchant/#/SignUp).&#x20;

## 2. Make your first API request

Use your PAT token to make a request to the GET Channels endpoint. You will need the channel ID to create products, orders and returns with the ShipBob API.

```
GET https://api.shipbob.com/1.0/channel
Headers
- Authorization: Bearer {insert token}
```

## 3. Common scenarios

A few common scenarios to get started with the ShipBob API. All endpoints are only accessible via `HTTPS`.

### Create product

Make sure to pass the `shipbob_channel_id` in the header.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json
  {
    "reference_id": "TShirtBlueM",
    "sku": "TShirtBlueM",
    "name": "Medium Blue T-Shirt"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create order

Similar to creating products, you need to pass the `shipbob_channel_id` in the header.&#x20;

<CodeGroup>
  ```json helloWorld.js
  {
    "shipping_method": "Standard",
    "recipient": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "address": {
        "address1": "100 Nowhere Blvd",
        "address2": "Suite 100",
        "city": "Gotham City",
        "state": "NJ",
        "country": "US",
        "zip_code": "07093"
      },
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone_number": "555-555-5555"
    },
    "products": [
      {
        "reference_id": "COF-LGT-REG",
        "name": "Light Roast Coffee",
        "quantity": 1,
      },
      {
        "reference_id": "COF-DARK-REG",
        "name": "Dark Roast Coffee",
        "quantity": 1,
      }
    ],
    "reference_id": "101",
    "order_number": "840343901234",
    "type": "DTC",
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>



### Create Warehouse Receiving Order

When you create warehouse receiving orders with the ShipBob API, you do not need to pass the `shipbob_channel_id`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript helloWorld.js
  {
    "fulfillment_center": {
      "id": 8
    },
    "package_type": "Package",
    "box_packaging_type": "EverythingInOneBox",
    "boxes": [
      {
        "tracking_number": "860C8CDC8F0B4FC7AB69AC86C20539EC",
        "box_items": [
          {
            "quantity": 1,
            "inventory_id": 0
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "expected_arrival_date": "2025-11-24T14:15:22Z",
    "purchase_order_number": "PO123"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
